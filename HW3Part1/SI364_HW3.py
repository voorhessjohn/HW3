## SI 364

## HW 3

## This homework has 2 parts. This file is the basis for HW 3 part 1.

## Add view functions to this Flask application code below so that the routes described in the README exist and render the templates they are supposed to (all templates provided inside the HW3Part1/templates directory).

from flask import Flask, request
app = Flask(__name__)
app.debug = True 

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World!'

@app.route('/user/<name>')
def hello_user(name):
    return '<h1>Hello {0}<h1>'.format(name)
