# Homework 3 - SI 364 F17

### Deadline: October 8, 2017 at 11:59 PM

## Instructions

This homework consists of 2 parts, each worth 250 points.

### Part 1

Edit the `SI364_HW3.py` file inside the `HW3Part1` directory to add routes to the basic Flask application that will match the templates in the `templates` subdirectory inside the `HW3Part1` folder.

When you are done, you should have the following four routes which render each of the corresponding templates with reasonable data:

* `http://localhost:5000/artistform` -> `artistform.html`
* `http://localhost:5000/artistinfo` -> `artist_info.html`
* `http://localhost:5000/artistlinks` -> `artist_links.html`
* `http://localhost:5000/specific/song/<artist_name>` -> `specific_artist.html`

Each of the templates should be rendered with actual data when those routes are reached when the Flask application runs. You do not need to edit the templates (but you will need to look at them to understand what data needs to be sent to them!).

### Part 2

Inside the provided directory `new_application`, there is an empty file `new_flask_app.py`, and an empty subdirectory `templates`.

To complete this part, write Flask application code in the empty file and add at least 2 HTML files to the `templates` subdirectory. 

The Flask application should have at least 2 routes (view functions). At least one of the routes should use a form to send data to the other one. (e.g. a form that, when submitted, sends the data input into the form to the other route)

The `templates` subdirectory here should contain at least 2 HTML files, which each get rendered when you access a different URL route while the Flask app is running.

For example, you could create a form that asks for your favorite English word. The other route could show *Your favorite word does not contain the letter 'z'* if there is no `z` character in the word you entered, and *Your favorite word contains the letter 'z'!* if there is.

That's a relatively simple data manipulation example, but that would completely fulfill the requirement! The only goal is to practice sending data and writing a template that will render dynamic data.

The only restriction is that you **may not get points for including view functions and/or routes that have been used in exercises/samples from lecture or section**. e.g. you should not submit a route `findcoolstuff` or `user/<name>`. It can be as minimal or as complicated as you want -- even if the data manipulation that your code does is simple (e.g. getting data about 1 word, and showing somethign different depending upon whether it includes the letter 'z'), the concepts you're dealing with here are quite challenging!
